first we use a form in html to get the name
then ofc the parameters/args in the URL change to reflect the input
using the action=/greet we call upon the greet() function which reads the args from the URL
and then renders a greet.html and passes along the name
THIS EXAMPLE USES THE GET METHOD, thus its wise only to use get method to get data since using it
to post some data can result in leaked info thru the URL

now in the second example we are combining both the functionalities into one route where we use POST to collect
the data safely
