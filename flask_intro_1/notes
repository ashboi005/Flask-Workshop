Introduction to Flask


What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight, micro web framework for Python.
It's used to build web applications and APIs quickly.
Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask doesn't require lots of components, making it easier to get started.

How does Flask work?
Flask works by routing URLs to specific Python functions.
When you visit a URL, Flask matches that URL with one of the routes and runs the associated function.


Basic Flask Syntax and Structure

Files needed:
app.py — This is where your Flask app's code lives.
templates/ folder — HTML templates live here.
static/ folder - CSS,JS and images live here.

Basic Syntax:
Flask: This imports Flask into your project.
app = Flask(__name__): Initializes the Flask application. This is a basic setup.
@app.route('/'): This is the route decorator that tells Flask which URL to respond to. In this case, it's the root /.
index(): This function is run when you visit the / URL.
render_template: It is used to send data to the HTML file in the templates folder.

What is @app.route?

Routing Basics:
@app.route() is used to map a URL to a function.
Inside the parentheses, you specify the URL. For example:
@app.route('/'): This route is the home page.
@app.route('/about'): This route is for the "about" page.

Route Parameters:
URLs can also accept parameters:
Example: @app.route('/greet/<name>')
In this case, name is a variable that will be passed to the function.
def greet(name)
